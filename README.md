# burger

This is an application that demonstrates the use of handlebars.js and mysql to pull data and also to write new data.

The user can input a type of burger they would like to "eat" and once they click submit, the burger will be stored in the mysql database and then be displayed on the page.

The user can then click on "Devour It" button which will update the database and display the devoured burger on the other side of the page.
